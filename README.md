Welcome

My name is Dave Peyton,

This is my resume that I have created as part of my Code Institute full stack coding course. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Challanges completed

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,
